# NeetCode 150

This repository contains my solutions to the **NeetCode 150** Data Structures & Algorithms problem set, implemented in **Java & Python**.  
The goal of this repository is to build strong problem-solving fundamentals, recognize common patterns, and maintain consistent daily practice for technical interview preparation.

---

## 🧭 Objectives
- Master core data structures and algorithms
- Develop pattern-based problem-solving skills
- Maintain daily consistency (no zero-days)
- Write clean, readable, and optimized solutions
- Build an interview-ready DSA foundation

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **Platform:** LeetCode / NeetCode  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

---

## 📁 Repository Structure
Problems are organized by topic following the NeetCode roadmap:



Each solution includes:
- Problem description & link
- Approach and intuition
- Time & space complexity

---

## 📌 Daily Workflow
1. Attempt 2–3 problems without looking at solutions
2. If stuck after ~60 minutes, revisit later with explanations
3. Implement a clean and optimized solution
4. Commit solutions daily to GitHub

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking
- **Start Date:** Spring 2026  
- **Target:** Complete NeetCode 150  
- **Commit Rule:** At least one meaningful commit per day  

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy
- Understand patterns, not just solutions
- Focus on clarity over clever tricks
- Optimize only after correctness
- Reflect weekly on mistakes and improvements

---

## 📎 Notes
This repository is for learning and interview preparation.  
Solutions are written after attempting problems independently.
